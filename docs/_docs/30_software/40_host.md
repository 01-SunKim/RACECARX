## MacOSX
in order to flash the latest jetpack in the jetson device, you need a Linux machine with Ubuntu 18.04. Note: The Nvidia installer has many dependencies and might lead to some issues after installation. I recommend to install it into a clean Virtual Machine.

* Prepare Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 18.04.
* Install Nvidia [Jetson SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) Manager
